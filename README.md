# BookingsAPI
Simple Booking API

Backend-focused Booking API built with .NET 8, .NET Core, EF Core 8, and Swagger

This API supports creating, editing, deleting, and retrieving bookings for holiday-related items (e.g. tickets ,apartments, vehicles, other). Availability is assumed, and persistence is intentionally limited to in-memory storage per the assessment brief.

No tests 
No UI

Built to spec.
